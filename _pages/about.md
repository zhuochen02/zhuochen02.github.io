Hi, I am a second year Ph.D. student at Data Intelligence Group (DIG), School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by [Prof. Wen Li](https://wenli-vision.github.io/) and [Prof. Lixin Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=inRIcS0AAAAJ). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor’s degree in the SCSE at UESTC. My research interests focus on deep generative models for visual content creation.
